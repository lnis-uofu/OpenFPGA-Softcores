# OpenFPGA-Softcores Documentation

This directory contains the Python API documentation on the OpenFPGA-Softcores plaform, powered by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

## Generating docs

To generate documentation as a webpage, run `make html` from this directory.
The output will be generated in `_build/html/index.html`.
You can either open up this file directly in a web browser, or serve the docs using `python -m http.server -d _build/html`.
This will display the documentation at http://localhost:8000.

If you have a Latex distribution installed, you can also generate PDF documentation through `make latexpdf`.
For a full list of targets Sphinx supports, run `make` from this directory.

## Docs structure

The documentation entry point is `source/index.rst`.

`source/conf.py` contains basic Sphinx configuration, including the project name, documentation theme, and extensions.
`Makefile` and `make.bat` provide build shortcuts, and are autogenerated by Sphinx itself.

## Writing docs

Sphinx supports [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) markup by default.
Docs can be written in prose using this markup language, and Python API docs can also be autogenerated from docstrings.
In order to add autogenerated Python API docs for a given module, insert the following placeholder into an rst file:

```
.. automodule:: platform.<mod_name>
    :members:
```

We've configured Sphinx using the [Napoleon](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/ ) extension to support Google-style Python docstrings.
For more info on how to write these, see the relevant [Google style guide section][google-style] and the [Napoleon documentation's examples][napoleon-examples].
