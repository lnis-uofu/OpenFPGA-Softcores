Welcome to OpenFPGA-Softcores' documentation!
=============================================

The goal of the project is to co-architect open-source processors (or soft-cores) and heterogeneous FPGA targets using the open-source `OpenFPGA <https://github.com/lnis-uofu/OpenFPGA>`_ framework.
The proposed platform acts as a Python API, wrapping EDA tools, for fast and accurate design space exploration.

.. note::
   This project is under active development.
